        This is an ongoing class practicing Qigong followed by miscellaneous
        training (Bagua, sensing hands etc.) and finishing with the Yang-style
        short form. All levels of experience are welcome, but please contact David
        for information on specific beginner sessions.

        Please contact David if you're interested in Qigong but are not ready to commit to learning
        Tai Chi.

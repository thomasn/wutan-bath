    Search the internet and you can find many independent martial arts instructors, but that&apos;s 
    not the case with the Wutan School, where the instructors can trace a lineage of teaching 
    back to Wu Chong (1712 - 1797), whose skills in martial arts so impressed a Taoist that he 
    taught the young Wu for ten years. Six generations later, those skills were taught to
    [Liu Yun Chiao](/about#liu-yun-chiao), who would become the founder of the Wutan school.

    Wutan UK, founded by [Master They Soon Tuan](/about#they-soon-tuan), was officially registered with the British 
    Kung Fu Council and Martial Arts Commission in March 1981.

    The Wutan school covers a range of martial arts, from Tai Chi, Bagua and Hsing I to Chai Lei Fut,
    Praying Mantis, Wing Chun, Ba Ji Chuan, Pi Qua, Mi Zhong and Kickboxing. All these arts 
    cover both the internal (meditative) and external (combative) features of the martial arts. To

    Bath Wutan has been going for more than three decades, providing the well-documented
    benefits of [Tai Chi](/about#tai-chi), [Kung Fu](/about#kung-fu) and [Qigong](/about#qigong). In fact, the NHS recommends Tai Chi and
    Qigong as forms of exercise and relaxation that can improve flexibility, mobility, balance and
    posture, as well as reduce stress and tension.

    Here&apos;s a brief history on how Wutan Bath came into being: due to an error in the Bath Chronicle, 
    in which the wrong location was printed, one day in 
    April 1991 around 40 students waited with great anticipation at Manvers St Baptist Church for a 
    Tai Chi demonstration, while Andrew Carter, the Wutan instructor, sat disconsolately in an empty
    hall at Holy Trinity Church on Monmouth Place! However, a successful session was achieved
    the following week.

    Wutan Bath was established in 1992. By the late 1990s the branch moved to Percy
    Community Centre on New King Street to accommodate much larger classes. In 2002, Wutan
    Bath moved to its current location, Hayesfield Lower School on Brougham Hayes. The branch
    has extended to additional instructors who teach at other sites.
tai-chi:
  title: Tai Chi
  description: |
    Tai chi is a gentle martial art that improves physical stability and balance through slow,
    flowing movements the form a series of postures following a sequence. It is primarily a 
    noncontact art that exercises the mind, body and soul.

    At [Wutan Bath](/about#wutan-bath) we teach the five traditional styles of Tai Chi, all of which have the same
    movements and sequences. The Yang style is a more gentle, flowing form that is often
    practised at a slower pace. The Chen style is more energetic and focuses on the martial arts
    aspect of the movements. There is also the Hao (Wu) style with its very small and subtle
    movements and higher stance, the Sun style that places an emphasis on agile footwork and
    the Wu style, which focuses on extending the body so it is leaning rather than being centred.

    Tai Chi, regardless of the style, is taught along with related arts such as [Qigong](/about#qigong) (an
    energetic series of movements used to get the muscles and blood moving freely), Sensing
    Hands (moving hands in tune with a partner), Hsing I (a form of Chinese boxing) and Pa Gua
    (circle walking) to give you a fully rounded martial arts education.
kung-fu:

    Wutan Kung Fu covers aspects of Wing Chun, Chai Lei Fut, Praying Mantis, Wing Chun, Ba Ji
    Chuan, Pi Qua, Mi Zhong and Kickboxing. While you might not recognize the names, you will
    almost certainly have heard of the Five Animals style of Chai Lei Fut, and Wing Chun is the
    art that started Bruce Lee&apos;s career.

    We cover a full range of techniques and training methods that focus on the students needs.
    They include forms practice, two-person practice, practical self-defence, sparring, sensitivity
    training and conditioning.

    Weapons training is added in time to further students understanding of the core principles
    of martial arts.

    All the classes are run in a friendly environment with an emphasis on developing confidence
    and discipline.
qigong:
  title: Qigong
  description: |
    Pronounced &apos;chi gong&apos;, qigong was developed as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    thousands of years ago. Today, there are many styles and forms of qigong (which is also
    known as chi kung). Different movements are used to open the flow of energy via meridians
    and acupuncture points to various organs, muscles, tendons and other tissues in the body
    and to promote body fluids such as blood, synovial and lymph. These movements, which can
    be dynamic or meditative, are made while taking long, slow breaths (qigong is from qi,
    meaning &apos;subtle breath&apos;, and gong, meaning &apos;skill cultivated through steady practise&apos;).

    Qigong is suitable for everyone, and our classes start with qigong as warm-up exercises
    before moving on to other forms.

liu-yun-qiao:
  name: Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao
  description: |
    At the age of seven, Liu Yun Qiao (1909&ndash;1992) began his training with Li Su Wen (1864&ndash;1934),
    perhaps the most famous practitioner of the six generations who were taught Pa Ze,
    starting with Wu Chong (1712&ndash;1797). Liu would eventually become the head trainer to the
    bodyguards for the president of China. Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao retired from his post in
    1966 and founded the Wutan martial arts school. He chose 12 disciples, most of whom were
    already highly skilled in martial arts, to teach them his skills. From this auspicious beginning,
    the Wutan School now has masters and schools throughout the world.
wu-song-fa:
  name: Master Wu Song Fa
  description: |
    One of Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao&apos;s senior disciples, Wu Song Fa (d. 2018) trained with
    Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao for many years before being accredited as having mastered the
    arts of Wutan. Master Wu taught many disciples in Malaysia, and he also gave in-depth
    training to 12 senior students in Wutan UK.
they-soon-tuan:
  name: Master They Soon Tuan
  description: |
    They Soon Tuan began learning the martial arts from his father by the age of seven,
    practising five hours a day, and at the age of 15 was put in charge of his Crane Kung Fu
    school. His Kung Fu master sent him to train under other teachers to learn different systems.
    After many years of training, Master Wu Song Fa accepted They as his student. On arriving in
    the UK to study at university, They founded a martial arts school here in 1977 to promote
    the correct teaching of authentic Chinese martial arts (which are collectively known as
    Wushu), and he was given permission by Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao to use the Wutan name
    in 1986.

    Master They has held the role of Taolu Director of the British Council for Chinese Martial
    Arts (BCCMA), instructing top athletes that include UK and international champions, and has
    trained British Wushu teams. His Wutan UK school has brought many thousands of people to
    greater health and happiness over more than four decades.
david-rutherford:
  name: David Rutherford
  description: |
    David was taught Tai Chi and Kung Fu by Andrew Carter, one of They&apos;s high-ranking senior
    instructors in the [Wutan](../about#wutan) school. When Andrew introduced Wutan to Bath in 1991 &ndash; initially
    with 5-hour sessions on Sunday afternoons &ndash; David completed the Tai Chi short form in 16
    weeks and also began Sensing Hands, Pa Kua, a Stick routine and Wu-style Tai Chi.

    Andrew had to return to the Wutan UK headquarters in Southampton after a year. David
    Rutherford, along with Steve Kruk and Martin Chivers, were determined to continue the
    school&apos;s presence in Bath, so they travelled to Southampton on Sundays for training with
    Master They Soon Tuan, the head of Wutan UK. At Southampton, David continued his training
    and also completed the 8 Palm Pa Kua sequence, Tai Chi Sword form and Broadsword form,
    along with their applications. It is natural to try and emulate your teacher in order to maintain the
    original &lsquo;message&rsquo;, and for years David has structured his class around Andrew&apos;s words and
    methods.

marick-baxter:
  name: Marick Baxter
  description: |
    From a young age, Marick has always been interested in the Chinese martial arts and the
    philosophy behind it. Throughout childhood he suffered from poor health, and when he started
    playing the flute, he realized that he needed to improve his health. He originally started to learn
    martial arts to help his flute playing and develop his focus &ndash; but not only did his health improve
    quickly, he discovered something much deeper in his inner being.

    Marick began his Tai Chi training with David Rutherford and studied Kung Fu and Chinese
    kickboxing under Martin Chivers at Wutan Bath in 1995. He trained wholeheartedly every hour he
    could and was soon training with Master Wu Song Fa during his regular visits to the UK. After
    Martin stopped teaching, Marick took on his Kung Fu classes and was invited to teach Tai Chi as
    well. Marick is fully committed to spreading Wutan&apos;s teachings.

james-davies:
  name: James Davies
  description: |
    After doing Yoga for 7 years, James felt he wanted something more active to compliment the progress he 
    had made with Yoga. He also needed to find a way of looking after himself physically to help his recovery 
    from various injuries. He started with Kung Fu and Kickboxing. He then went to Tai Chi as a kind of 
    &lsquo;why not?&rsquo;. He didn't expect it to offer anything different to Yoga and Kung Fu, but not only did he find 
    that Tai Chi complimented both of them beautifully, it also has much to add. While he has benefited greatly 
    physically, the emotional and psychological well-being he has experienced have been life changing, and he 
    has made many friends and great memories along the way. 

    James feels honoured to be teaching for the Wutan school. He feels traditional Chinese martial arts are 
    truly a treasure that can really help our collective future. He is joined by his partner in teaching his 
    classes and is proud that their children are all still actively training and assist them with teaching. 
    He will always be grateful for the day he joined Wutan and believes that training in Tai Chi, Kung Fu and 
    Kickboxing with Wutan for the last 20 or so years has provided him with so much.

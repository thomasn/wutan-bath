# About Wutan

The Wutan school started in China in 1966 under the auspices of Grand Master Liu Yun Qiao; one of his disciples, Master Wu Song Fa, in turn taught Sifu They Soon Tuan who founded the UK branch of the school in 1977. It is currently the largest martial arts school in the UK.

The Wutan school covers a range of martial arts such as Tai Chi, Bagua, Hsing I, Chai Lei Fut, Wing Chun and Kickboxing. All arts cover both internal/meditative and external/combatative features.

To find out more about the Wutan school as a whole, check out the [Wutan website](http://www.wutan.biz/).

# About Wutan Bath

The Bath branch of Wutan has been running since 1992, started by David Rutherford. We currently have a number of classes covering the Wutan syllabus, most of which are beginner-friendly and some tailored to specific ages or levels of physical ability.

## Tai Chi

Tai Chi is a gentle martial art that improves physical balance and stability through slow, flowing movement. It is a primarily non-contact art.

At Wutan Bath we combine it with related arts such as Qi Gung (a more energetic series of movements used to get muscles and blood moving freely), Sensing Hands (moving with a partner), Hsing I, and Pa Gua (circle-walking) to give you a fully-rounded education.

## Kung Fu

Wutan Kung Fu covers aspects of Wing Chun and Chai Lei Fut. While you might not recognise the names, you will almost certainly have heard of the Five Animals styles of Chai Lei Fut, and Wing Chun is the art that started Bruce Lee's career.

Wutan Bath's Kung Fu classes include Chai Lei Fut, Wing Chun Preying Mantis style and Chinese Kickboxing.
